/**
 * Approve or decline a member's pending sign-in/sign-out. Admins only.
 *
 * Approving is the only thing in the app that writes a presence State, and it
 * applies exactly one transition:
 *   Sign In  -> On Site,           stamping signedInAt
 *   Sign Out -> Expected Back when they said they are returning, otherwise
 *              Off Site. Both stamp signedOutAt.
 *
 * Declining touches nothing but the request itself. A declined member keeps
 * whatever state they already had, because "no" to leaving is not the same as
 * being told they are on site.
