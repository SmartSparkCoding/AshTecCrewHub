/**
 * Tour content. Every step points at a real element via a `data-tour` attribute,
 * so the copy can never drift away from what is actually on screen.
 *
 * `advance: 'target'` means the tour waits for the user to click the highlighted
 * element. That is only ever used for read-only navigation (nav links, the
 * admin dropdown), because a tour must not save a profile, add a crew member or
 * submit a response on the user's behalf. Anything that writes uses 'next'.
 *
 * Roles: an Actor lands on Stage Layout at '/', so they must never be shown the
 * show-response copy. Admin steps are filtered out for everyone else.
